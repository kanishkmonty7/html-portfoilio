  <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prepare Paneer: Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan and lightly fry the paneer cubes until they turn golden brown. Remove from heat and soak them in warm water for 15-20 minutes. This step helps to keep the paneer soft.</li>
<li>Make the Gravy: In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and butter. Once heated, add chopped onions and saut√© until they turn translucent.</li>
<li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
<li>Pour in the tomato puree and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil separates from the sides.</li>
<li>Spice it Up: Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Stir well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Blend it Smooth: Once the mixture is cooked and the spices are well incorporated, let it cool slightly. Then, blend it into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor.</li>
<li>Finish the Dish: Transfer the blended mixture back to the pan. Add kasuri methi and salt. Stir well.</li>
<li>Pour in the cream and mix until well combined. Let it simmer for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Add Paneer: Drain the paneer cubes from water and add them to the gravy. Gently mix them in, making sure not to break the paneer.</li>
<li>Final Touch: Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a drizzle of cream if desired.</li>
<li>Serve: Serve hot with naan, rice, or your choice of Indian bread.</li>
</ol>
